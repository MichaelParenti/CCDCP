            <b>Stage One</b> in the Church Planting process is <b>IMAGINE</b>.
            <br>
            In this process, you are encouraged to spend time in prayer seeking guidance from God to determine WHERE and TO WHOM you could reach the gospel with.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this stage, IMAGINE the answers for these four questions…
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Where</b> do you sense God calling you to serve?</li>
                <li><b>What people group</b> do you sense God calling you to specifically target in your efforts?</li>
                <li><b>What "style"</b> of church do you think would be most impactful in reaching that people group?</li>
                <li><b>What church "model"</b> do you think would best accommodate your needs?</li>
            </ul>            
            <br>
            See below for more details about a church style and church model.
            <br>
            When you have a general answer to these four questions, please complete the form at the bottom of the page to begin connecting with the help of a coach, a team of planters, conferences, and more.

                <h1>Church Models</h1>

                <p>
                    Church “Model” refers to the structure the church plant could possibly take.
                    <br>
                    Below are some sample models.
                    <br>
                    A church could possibly be a hybrid of a couple different models.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Church “Type” is different from the church “Model.”
                    <br>
                    For example, a Table Church (type) could use a House Church Model meeting in one home, or a Table Church (type) could use an Organic Model that moves from place to place.
                </p>
